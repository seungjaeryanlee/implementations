# Paper Implementations

Welcome to my centralized repository for all my paper implementations! Every implementation is in its own repository, but they are included as submodules here for easy access.

To maximize clarity and reproducibility, every repository uses Travis CI to enforce consistent code style (`black`, `flake8`, `flake8-bugbears`, `isort`) and detailed documentation (`flake8-docstring`). Also, to enable customization, every repository uses `configargparse` for easy configuration. For more details, check [**this template repository**](https://github.com/seungjaeryanlee/implementations-template) or any implementation.

### Finished Implementations ⌛

1. [**[NFQ]** Neural Fitted Q Iteration - First Experiences with a Data Efficient Neural Reinforcement Learning Method](/papers/nfq.pdf)
2. [**[DQN]** Human-level control through Deep Reinforcement Learning](/papers/dqn.pdf)

### Ongoing Implementations ⏳

There is no paper that I am currently implementing. There will be one soon though!

### Planned Implementations 🔜

- [**[DDQN]** Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)
- [**[DuDQN]** Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
- [**[PER]** Prioritized Experience Replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)
